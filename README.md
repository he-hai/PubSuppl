### 0. [0_ecoli_models](0_ecoli_models)
The directory contains *E. coli* genome-scale metabolic model: the **core model** and the most updated model ***i*ML1515**, and some notes on the models. 

### 1. [2020_formaldehyde condensation](2020_formaldehyde%20condensation)
The directory contains Jupyter notebooks of modelling _in vivo_ formaldehyde-THF
condensation ([He *et al.*, *Metabolites* 2020](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo10020065)). 

The formaldehyde-THF spontaneous condensation reaction was added to the 
adjusted *E. coli* genome-scale metabolic model [*i*ML1515](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3956). 
Flux balance analysis and [phenotypic phase plane](https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.10047) 
calculations were conducted using [COBRApy](https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-7-74).


### 2. [2020_Promiscuous aldolases](2020_Promiscuous%20aldolases)
The directory contains Jupyter notebooks of MDF and FBA modeling of the newly designed formaldehyde assimilation pathway, the homoserine cycle ([He *et al.*, *Metabolic Engineering* 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2020.03.002)).

### 3. [2020_GED](2020_GED)
The directory contains Jupyter notebook of FBA modeling of bioproduction via the newly identified GED (Gnd-Entner-Doudoroff) cycle from CO<sub>2</sub> ([Satanowski & Dronsella *et al.*, *bioRxiv* 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.102244)).

### 4. [2020_Energy_Auxotroph](2020_Energy_Auxotroph/LPD_FBA.ipynb)
The directory contains Jupyter notebook of FBA modeling of different NADH producing routes within a “energy-auxotroph” strain, _&Delta;lpd_ strain ([Wenk & Schann *et al.*, *Biotechnology & Bioengineering* 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27490)).

### 5. [2020_TaCo](2020_TaCO)
